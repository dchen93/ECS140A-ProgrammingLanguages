Overall: Any comment/discussion related to this HW.

Part 1 Questions:
#1: Putback is used to skip comments and whitespaces from being tokens
#2: c = o, putback = false
#3: The case statements in this question are needed because they are required in guarded commands.
	For example, / is the dividing symbol which can be used in an arithmetic problem for division. However,
	if it is followed by a "=" symbol, this becomes a "!=" also known as "not equals" symbol.
	Using annother example, - is the minus symbol which can be used in an arithmetic problem but if followed
	by a ">" symbol, this becomes an arrow. Same goes for ":" which when followed by an "=" symbol,
	it becomes an assignment operator.
